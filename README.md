# Career Assistant - Bootstrap Commit

This repository was initialized by the secure bootstrap script.

This commit contains a starter skeleton for frontend, backend and desktop-app.
After you run the script and confirm the initial push, I will expand the repository with the full project files (frontend pages, backend API, job scrapers, desktop app skeleton, CI/workflows, and deployment helpers).
